> <em>**ENTIRE WEBSITE IS HARDCODED, AKA LEGIT WORK :)**</em>

Working on the documentation, credits & stuff, I'll update soon !.. 

Firstly, I would like to mention that this was a 1 week solo project and it turned out awsm ! <br>
Secondly, everything in this project is hardcoded from scratch ! & <br>
At last, Hi & I appreciate the time you took to visit this page.<br>


## About
>This project started as a project to my portfolio.
>As an event website for cit, AI & DS DEPT. Symposium.
>The project took a duration of 1.5 weeks.
>I wanted things to look unique & different so i decided to hardcode everything.
>All element are built from scratch.
>It sure does stand out from UI/UX designers perspective
>My objective was clear from the start, credit & addition of portfolio project. nothing else.
>on second thought, i couldev made it better but thats for another time given that this projects time constrain was limited.
>lots of things were worked on here, like website compression (<4mb), speed, responsiveness, event page, popup page, animation, file heirarchy, release, trailer, analytics, content, simplicity, ui/ux, etc.
>I had a good time working on this project, the usesr feedback was positive overall...
>I usually work on more advanced projects like OS's, Mods, Tools & Automation scripts.. but this was a side quest for me xD

## Things I would like to improvise  
  - add poster/pic section in the "more" about event page (embed insta post or add pic) (use js switch or add below title of event).
  - make sponsors list in main page scrollable horizontally when expanded (with logo & text of company).
  - make credit page responsive or instead of an hardcode, just make it as an video.. makes life easier ;).
  - add another column in contact section, be it email or some other option in the main menu (add js third dot for mobile view and split view for pc) (for pc, no third dot, instead split the container into 2 & one half phone other half other detail).
  - add animation to hamburger menu/elements during open/close (bg blur animation & other popup animations) (rn its using display hide/view... make it a combination of z index - & + with transition).
  - make all nav-bar text color negative (when in light mode only coz interferes with white bg).
  - light mode toggle more accessible (in mobile view), maybe try with a frame and icon inside the circle like in desktop view... 
  - also center the theme toggle 
  - improvise the loading animation.
  - really need to move to a new domain, like talos.co.in or sub domain of https://www.citchennai.edu.in/talos <--works , cant put a professional site in a shit-unprofessional domain & deal with the problems it gives.., really countin on this one... like all the effort and work to display it on a free unsecure domain ? O_O THINK AGAIN !
  - make scroll more lite for mobile view (especially 2nd section which has hardcoded scroll animation which looks dope on desktop but need tweaks for mobile view)
  - add cookies (theme, cache, events_list)
  - Implement a dedicated registration page/form with website theme (link gform with key id of our website)
  - add current terms & condition page & coockie policy to a dedicated page under same repo
  - Some thoughts after seeing other dept website, we need more content for our site.. its kinda blank
  - showcase some video or article frame realted to our event
  - fix the button under text box in event
  - fix theme toggle visibility in mobile view
  - fix the img in cards for X-treme low width devices
  - add prize & registration fee/mode info under every event page
  - desktop popup needs js for pages system, already talked abt this in poster topic but something more to it
  - fix desktop popup scaling on xtreme height device by setting max-height & make scollable for low xtreme height devices
  - remove pointer dot in mobile view in registration pages
  - remove underline under title in registration pages in mobile view
  - hide nav bar on scroll down only for desktop view, (already there, but commented it... just disable for mobile n uncomment karo)
  - maybe try adding nav bar blur, like apple
  - add registration/venue/time details properly instead of buttons (idk, lets give it a try)
  - add event category section with event counter 
  - add arrow pointing down in mobile view (for swipe down hint for idiots)
  - add some description under section title, especially for technical & non technical events.. so that it adds some content to the site
  - in section 2, ("brought to you by aids"), add cit & talos logo or somthin similar... would look cool
  - change favicon.. or add a bg or somthing.. it is not visible in mobile dark view
  - fix mobile share button in event-more page
                                                                                                                      


Most of 'em are really easy to implement<br>
Just require some tweakin..<br>
Imma leave it Here...<br>
