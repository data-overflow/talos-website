*ENTIRE WEBSITE IS HARDCODED, AKA LEGIT WORK :)*

Working on the documentation, creedits & stuff, I'll update soon !.. 

Firstly, I would like to mention that this was a 1 week solo project and it turned out awsm ! 
Secondly, everything in this project is hardcoded from scratch !

##Things I would like to improvise on this build -
- add poster section in the "more" about event page (embed insta post or add pic) (use js switch or add below title of event).
- make sponsors list in main page scrollable horizontally when expanded (with logo & text of company).
- make credit page responsive or instead of an hardcode, just make it as an video.. makes life easier ;).
- add another column in contact section, be it email or some other option in the main menu (add js third dot for mobile view and split view for pc) (for pc, no third dot, instead split the container into 2 & one half phone other half other detail).
- add animation to hamburger menu/elements during open/close (bg blur animation & other popup animations) (rn its using display hide/view... make it a combination of z index - & + with transition).
- make all nav-bar text color negative (when in light mode only coz interferes with white bg).
- light mode toggle more accessible (in mobile view), maybe try with a frame and icon inside the circle like in desktop view... 
- also center the theme toggle 
- improvise the loading animation.
- really need to move to a new domain, like talos.co.in or sub domain of ![](https://www.citchennai.edu.in/talos) <--works , cant put a professional site in a shit-unprofessional domain & deal with the problems it gives.., really countin on this one... like all the effort and work to display it on a free unsecure domain ? O_O THINK AGAIN !
- make scroll more lite for mobile view (especially 2nd section which has hardcoded scroll animation which looks dope on desktop but need tweaks for mobile view)
- add cookies (theme, cache, events_list)
- Implement a dedicated registration page/form with website theme (link gform with key id of our website)
- add current terms & condition page & coockie policy to a dedicated page under same repo

Most of 'em are really easy to implement, 
Just require some tweakin.. 
Imma leave it Here... 

No Kanging ! Coz I Need the fukin credits & contact me before you do anything !
