![](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=jesvijonathan)


working on the documentation, creedits & stuff, ill update soon !.. 

Things I would improvise on this build -

- add poster section in the more about event page (embed insta post or add pic) (use js switch or add below title of event).
- make sponsors list in main page scrollable horizontally when expanded.
- make credit page responsive or instead of an hardcode, just make it as an video.. makes life easier ;).
- add another column in contact section, be it email or some other option in the main menu (add js third dot for mobile view and split view for pc).
- add animation to hamburger menu open (bg blur animation & other popup animations) (rn its using display hide/view... make it a combination of z index - & + with transition).
- make all text in nav bar color negative (when in light mode only).
- light mode toggle more accessible with a frame and icon inside the circle (in mobile view)
- improvise the loading animation.
- really need to move to a new domain, like talos.co.in or sub domain of citchennai.edu/talos ..., cant put a professional site in a shit-unprofessional domain & deal with the problems it gives.., really countin on this one... like all the effort and work to display it on a free unsecure domain ? O_O
- make scroll lighter for mobile view (especially 2nd section)
- add cookies (theme, cache, events)
- Implement a dedicated registration page/form with website theme (link gform with key id of our website)
- add current terms & condition page to a dedicated page under same repo
- most em are really easy to implement, just require some etweakin.. Imma leave it there... No Kanging ! Need the fukin credits & contact me before you do anything !
